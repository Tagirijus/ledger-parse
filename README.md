# Description

A very simple ledger-parser for ledger-cli journal files. It probably does not parse everything and it is probably buggy. Handle with care!

# Usage

Simply import this module either by putting the `ledger-parse.py` file into the folder of your python script, or into the pythons modules path (maybe something like `/usr/lib/python2.7`). Then just use `import ledger-parse` to import the module.
